# What is this
This is a personal project for me to learn Python while also creating a way to talk with an AI.
Everything is still in an unstable development phase, and it's not designed to run on any computer other than my own.

# How to use
Launch [VOICEVOX](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/) and [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)
then run  `python conversation.py`

Note: main.py is currently under maintenance and is not operational.
